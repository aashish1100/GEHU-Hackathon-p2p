# GEHU-Hackathon-p2p

A peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and messaging application developed during the GEHU Hackathon 2025.

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a decentralized P2P network using UDP sockets in Node.js, enabling users to:

- Discover peers on the local network
- Exchange real-time text messages
- Transfer files in chunks
- Maintain an active peer list without centralized servers

## 🚀 Features

- **🔍 Peer Discovery**: Uses UDP broadcasting to find peers in the local network.
- **💬 Messaging**: Send and receive real-time messages between connected peers.
- **📁 File Transfer**: Split large files into chunks, send over the network, and reconstruct them at the receiver's end.
- **🔄 Active Peer Management**: Continuously monitors and updates the list of active peers.
